# Kayleen Carido – Creative Developer

A static site of my portfolio built with the simpler things in life – vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🍦

## Intro
In 2022, I'm challenging myself to commit to freelancing, an idea I've been thinking about doing for the last 2 years. I figured if I'm going to venture in a business that promotes value in web presence, I need to walk the walk. Here I am.

## Takeaways
I originally wanted to create a portfolio on a CMS, and even contemplating using an HTML template. However I wanted to prove to myself that after dabbling in simple front-end technologies for so long, that I could code a simple website that is both well-designed and functionally coded.
